Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Gideon.

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with programming to bring my ideas to life.

My passion currently lies in web development. I love learning new frameworks and technologies, and using them to build web applications.

My most recent project is [Quiz Qrafter](https://quizqrafter.onrender.com), an AI-driven quiz generator that helps students study for their exams.
